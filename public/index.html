            Here's your simple budget calculator to help you stay on track with your budget and monetary goals. List all your fixed bills you have each month; your "cost of living." This allows you to put aside that money already. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Examples: savings, rent, car payment, insurance, groceries (if consistent), phone/cable bills, etc. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Calculate and keep track of what's left. This is your monthly budget, which is your extra "spending money".  
            <br>
            <br>
            Your "spending money" is broken down week by week. This can be what you spend for fun, or unoccured expensenes. By adding each item daily for the week, it will help contiously keep track of what you spend your money on. 
            <br>
            <br> 
            If you find yourself going over your weekly limit, you can review where your spending habits focus. Then adjust how much you spend on those things, or be honest with yourself and give yourself more weekly spending money from your monthly budget you set for yourself. Or consider to yourself if you can curb habits.
            <br>
            <br>
            The first couple weeks are crucial to add each item to build the habit and monitor. At the same time don't beat yourself up if you go over your limits, you're still finding your baseline. Just make sure to adjust either your monthly budget or your spending habits.
