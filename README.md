Never sure where your money goes? 

Keep track and break down how much you have to spend by the week. 

Add your current monthly income.
Add any fixed monthly expenses. Rent, car payment, savings, insurance, etc. 
The app then breaks down what you have left to spend on misc. 
Record those daily misc items and keep an eye in relation to your weekly "spending money."
