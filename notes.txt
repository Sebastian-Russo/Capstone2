* Define Your App's Purpose *

To track the daily, weekly, and monthly budget of a user's spending habits and prevent over spending.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
* Write Your App Idea Down *

The app should be a daily budget tracker of budget spending habits. The user can set their monthly and/or weekly budget. It will focus on weekly budget, so the user stays concious of it the whole week. Keeps the same budget each week, and can get feed back on their own spending habits and how close they are to accurately staying on budget. By inputting each item, the user remains concious of what they're spending, and the math in the background shows them how much is spent and left for their week.
If a user needs to change their weekly budget, they can see the effects a weekly budget has on a month, or year: i.e. changing a weekly budget by $50, means $200 in a month, which can be one's car payment. Do they need to change their budget, can the afford it? Or can they change their habits to reach their goals?
A category section for the user to choose if this item is a necessity or a want will serve as another reminder, and also show the user as the week goes on, what's dominating their useage.
